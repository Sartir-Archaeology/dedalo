* This a sample of Dédalo tool.
* You can use it as start point to create new tools and maybe, to contribute to the community with your work.
*
* How to create a new tool:
* 	1 - Enter to Dédalo at Area Development > Tools > Tools Development (url like /dedalo/core/page/?t=dd1340)
* 	2 - Create a new tool record using the 'New' button
* 	3 - Fill the information about the new tool, name, label, scope, custom labels, etc. you can see samples in existing tools.
* 		The name of the tool must start with 'tool_' and shouldn't contain spaces, accents or non ASCII chars to prevent future errors with paths, etc.
* 		A good name could be 'tool_numisdata_import' where 'tool_' is the mandatory prefix, 'numisdata' is the TLD from creator and 'import' is the main description of the tool.
* 		In the label, you could be more explicit like 'Tool to import Numisdata custom files'
