## 1. What is Dédalo?

Dédalo is a knowledge management system for tangible and intangible Cultural Heritage, Natural Heritage and Oral History and Memory.

[Official Dédalo webpage](https://dedalo.dev)

Dédalo is a Free and Open Source software based on a new paradigm of programming: developing objects with an ontology model. The ontology controls the app flow with the descriptors, related terms, no descriptors, TG, TE, etc. Objects are built with a MVC structure and are linked to the ontology. The database uses a NoSQL model, storing all data in JSONB (binary) format.

Dédalo uses the structured Ontology in order to:

1. Make the data structured (user data is stored without a fixed structure).
2. Build the programming objects during execution time.
3. Interpret the code and the data to translate it to multiple formats (RDF, JSON-LD, SQL, CSV, XML, Dublin Core, HTML, PDF, etc.).

The ontology can be modified, subsequently changing the data and the code. You can (1) develop new functionalities without changing the data and (2) alter the metadata independently of the code and the data.

Dédalo is based on a linked data model and uses a relative, multi-reference, universal locator. Such locator can find
entities, sections, components, and tags. In other words, it can locate archives (in others entities), records, fields, and part of the fields (sub-field data).

Dédalo can use any language for its user interface and the managed data. It has a multi-thesaurus engine and can manage multiple resources and resolutions for video, image, pdf, notation scores, etc.

Dédalo has a geo-reference for cultural properties, interviews... with points, areas, paths... as well as an indexation and relational model of multiple data sources within the thesaurus.

Dédalo can handle and cut video in real time to find thematic fragments of interviews or cultural goods. 4K, 1080p, 720p, and 404p resolutions are supported.

[Dedalo V5](https://dedalo.dev/v5)

### 5.2. Video-guide for V5 installation

Then, you can follow the steps in the V5 installation video (similar for V6):
[Dedalo V5 installation video on CentOS](https://dedalo.dev/v5_install)

### 5.3. Manual installation

Then, install Dédalo manually (provisional installation instructions for V6 beta):

1. Download Dédalo and place it under the httpdocs directory of the web server.
2. Create a database in PostgreSQL named `dedalo_xx` (you can change the `xx` as you please).
3. Rename `[...]/dedalo/config/sample.config.php` to `[...]/dedalo/config/config.php`.
4. Modify `[...]/dedalo/config/config.php` as you need. Usually, this involves the `DEDALO_ENTITY` string and the OS library paths.
5. Rename `[...]/dedalo/config/sample.config_db.php` to `[...]/dedalo/config/config_db.php`.
6. Modify `[...]/dedalo/config/config_db.php` with your database configuration.
7. Rename `[...]/dedalo/config/sample.config_core.php` to `[...]/dedalo/config/config_core.php`.
8. Rename `[...]/dedalo/config/sample.config_areas.php` to `[...]/dedalo/config/config_areas.php`.
9. Open Dédalo in the browser.
10. Follow the instructions.
11. Once the installation process is done, log in and head to the Development Area. There, update the Ontology and register all tools.
12. Create an admin user.
13. Log out and log in with the admin user.
14. Create Users and Projects as you need.

**Note:** the beta state does not have cache control. Hence, we recommend opening the web browser console and deleting the browser cache during the beta period.

## 6. Update

*Please read the "Updates.md" file for specific notes, procedures, etc, of the versions.*

Dédalo has three main updates procedures:

1. Update the code files (php, js, css, html, etc.)
    - Create a backup of all files.
    - Download the new files and change the files in your server.
    - You will need see the new config files and put the changes into your own config files (/dedalo/config/config.php and /dedalo/config/config_db.php) is not possible change this files automatically because are the configuration files and it has specific pw and paths of the users. If you don't change the config files, Dédalo will require the new "define" variables and will stop the app.

2. Update the ontology structure with the sections, components, list, etc.
    - Do the first update step
    - Log-in with any "developer" user.
    - You will see an indication, an "orange" or "red" box, to the left of menu (red box, if you have the debugger active) a "grey" sub-menu with your server configuration, and a new "Development" menu, press it to go to the "admin utils" page.
    - Locate the "Update Ontology" panel and press the "Update Dédalo ontology to the latest version" button, if all go well you will see a "green" alert.
    - Log-out and log-in with a normal admin user.

3. Update the data in your installation
    - Do the first and second update steps
    - Log-in with any "developer" user.
    - You will see an indication, an "orange" or "red" box, to the left of menu (red box, if you have the debugger active) a "grey" sub-menu with your server configuration, and a new "Development" menu, press it to go to the "admin utils" page.
    - Locate the "Update Data" panel. If your data version is different that the "code files" version, Dédalo will show that you need update, press the «update» link and wait for notifications.
    - If all go well you will see a report with the changes.
    - Reload the page 'Administration Tools'. Sometimes, if the update differs in several versions, you will need to update the data to each of the intermediate versions (v6.0.9 pass from v6.0.9 to -> v6.0.10, v6.0.10 to -> v6.0.11, etc) when the data and "code files" are in the same version, Dédalo will show that is consistent and stop the upgrade process.
    - Log-out and log-in with normal admin user.
    - Optional: in the inventory pages (OH, PCI, etc) press the "Update Cache" into the list of the sections for update some changes into the components (this task force to update all components with the new model no 1 to 1), and will apply the changes to the data into the databases.

## 7. Importing toponymy

1. Create the toponymy into the Hierarchy menu into Thesaurus:
    - Log in into Dédalo
    - Go to the "Thesaurus -> Hierarchy" section
    - Find the country that you want import
    - Edit the country
    - Change the "active" field to "Yes"
    - Press the "Generate" button

2. The toponymy is ready for import the data in SQL.

     - Log out from Dédalo
     - Go to: /dedalo/install/import/hierarchy
     - Select the hierarchies to be imported with the postgreSQL copy command, similar to:
        - psql dedalo4_XXX -U YYY -p 5432 -h localhost -c "\copy matrix_hierarchy(section_id, section_tipo, datos) from es1.copy "
        - XXX: the name of your installation
        - YYY: the name of your user
     - You can list all exported tables and change the "es1.copy" to the hierarchies that you want import
     - When you are import the toponymy data, you will need change the counters of the tables that you were imported.
     - Login to Dédalo with developer user
     - Go to the "administration tool" and see the:
        - DEDALO COUNTERS STATE
     - You will see the diferences and Dédalo show the SQL command to apply into the postgreSQL, similar to this:
        - UPDATE "matrix_counter" SET dato = 75845 WHERE tipo = 'es1';
     - This command will change the counters to the new imported values in SQL
     - Change the profiles to access users to the new hierarchy.

    Done! you new hierarchy was imported and ready to use.

## 8. Server system

The backend of Dédalo is tested in:

- Ubuntu Server 20.04+
- Debian 9.0+
- MacOs X 11.0+
- CentOS, Fedora and RedHat situation. We are no longer testing Dédalo in RedHat/CenOS/Fedora model since the CentOS project focus was shifted. The main OS to test Dédalo will be Ubuntu. RedHat/CentOS/Fedora will become part of the "all other Linux that we do not test" category.

[CentOS blog](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=future-is-centos-stream)

Any other Linux will probably be compatible, but we offer NO GUARANTEES.

Windows: Dédalo might run, but we HAVE NOT TESTED IT.
